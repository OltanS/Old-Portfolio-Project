                        I implemented a ResNet architecture from scratch, gaining a deeper understanding
                        of the inner processes of neural networks. The structure was used to classify images of cats with different fur patterns,
                        and reached a testing accuracy of up to 80% with 8 classes. This was a part of the UNSW Course Neural Networks (COMP9444)
                        for which I got a High Distinction grade/

                    After receiving the Taste of Research Scholarship from UNSW, I had the opportunity to work with a Fetch Robot.
                    I developed a set of scenarios for participants to re-enact, and collected data regarding their movement to improve
                    the field of Social Robotics.

                    I Classified and compared the effectiveness of different methods for various computer vision tasks in a group setting.
                    This was greatly helped by the computer vision course I took at UNSW (COMP9517) for which I had a High Distinction grade.
